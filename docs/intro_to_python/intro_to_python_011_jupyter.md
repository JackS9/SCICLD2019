# Accessing Jupyter Notebook

## About Jupyter

Project Jupyter evolved from the IPython Project to support interactive data science and
scientific computing across all programming languages.

## Several options for accessing a Jupyter Notebook

---
* The [Jupyter website](https://www.jupyter.org) allows you to download Jupyter Notebook and/or try it in your browser.

* The [TACC Vis Portal](https://vis.tacc.utexas.edu) allows TACC users to run Jupyter
through your browser on Stampede, Maverick, or Wrangler if the user has an allocation on that system.

* The TACC [DesignSafe Portal](https://www.designsafe-ci.org) allows anyone with a TACC account to use Jupyter.  Instructions are available [here](intro_to_python_012_designsafe.md).

* The Agave portal includes a Jupyter notebook.  Instructures for access via Agave Portal are [here](intro_to_python_013_agave.md).
