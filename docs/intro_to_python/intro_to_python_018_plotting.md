# Python - Functions & Plotting

**Objectives:**
- Discover functions and apply functions.
- Plot simple graphs from data.

## Functions

Often, we want to do more than add, subtract, multiply, and divide values of data.
NumPy knows how to do more complex operations on arrays.
If we want to find the average inflammation for all patients on all days,
for example,
we can ask NumPy to compute `data`'s mean value:

~~~python
print(numpy.mean(data))
~~~

`mean` is a **function** that takes an array as an **argument**.
If variables are nouns, functions are verbs: they do things with variables.

NumPy has lots of useful functions that take an array as input.
Let's use three of those functions to get some descriptive values about the dataset.
We'll also use multiple assignment, a convenient Python feature that will enable us to do this all in one line.

~~~python
maxval, minval, stdval = numpy.max(data), numpy.min(data), numpy.std(data)

print('maximum inflammation:', maxval)
print('minimum inflammation:', minval)
print('standard deviation:', stdval)
~~~

When analyzing data, though, we often want to look at partial statistics,
such as the maximum value per patient or the average value per day.
One way to do this is to create a new temporary array of the data we want,
then ask it to do the calculation:

~~~python
patient_0 = data[0, :] # 0 on the first axis, everything on the second
print('maximum inflammation for patient 0:', patient_0.max())
~~~

> Everything in a line of code following the '#' symbol is a [comment](python_reference.md#comment)

> Comments allow programmers to leave explanatory notes for other programmers or their future selves.

We don't actually need to store the row in a variable of its own.
Instead, we can combine the selection and the function call:

~~~python
print('maximum inflammation for patient 2:', numpy.max(data[2, :]))
~~~

What if we need the maximum inflammation for each patient over all days (as in the
next diagram on the left), or the average for each day (as in the
diagram on the right)? As the diagram below shows, we want to perform the
operation across an axis:

![Operations Across Axes](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/fig/python-operations-across-axes.png)

To support this, most array functions allow us to specify the axis we want to work on.
We can ask for the average across axis 0 (rows in our 2D example):

~~~python
print(numpy.mean(data, axis=0))
~~~

As a quick check, we can ask this array what its shape is:

~~~python
print(numpy.mean(data, axis=0).shape)
~~~

The expression `(40,)` tells us we have an NÃ—1 vector,
so this is the average inflammation per day for all patients.
We can average across axis 1 (columns in our 2D example):

~~~python
print(numpy.mean(data, axis=1))
~~~

which is the average inflammation per patient across all days.

## Plotting

While there is no "official" plotting library, Python's `matplotlib` is the de facto standard.
First, we will import the `matplotlib` module
and use two of its functions to create and display a heat map of our data:

~~~python
import matplotlib
%matplotlib inline
image = matplotlib.pyplot.imshow(data)
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
~~~

![Heatmap of the Data](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/fig/01-numpy_71_0.png)

Blue regions in this heat map are low values, while red shows high values.
As we can see, inflammation rises and falls over a 40-day period.

Let's take a look at the average inflammation over time:

~~~python
ave_inflammation = numpy.mean(data, axis=0)
ave_plot = matplotlib.pyplot.plot(ave_inflammation)
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
~~~

![Average Inflammation Over Time](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/fig/01-numpy_73_0.png)

Here, we have put the average per day across all patients in the variable `ave_inflammation`,
then asked `matplotlib.pyplot` to create and display a line graph of those values.
The result is roughly a linear rise and fall, which is suspicious:
based on other studies, we expect a sharper rise and slower fall.
Let's have a look at two other statistics:

~~~python
max_plot = matplotlib.pyplot.plot(numpy.max(data, axis=0))
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
~~~

![Maximum Value Along The First Axis](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/fig/01-numpy_75_1.png)

~~~python
min_plot = matplotlib.pyplot.plot(numpy.min(data, axis=0))
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
~~~

![Minimum Value Along The First Axis](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/fig/01-numpy_75_3.png)

The maximum value rises and falls perfectly smoothly,
while the minimum seems to be a step function.
Neither result seems particularly likely,
so either there's a mistake in our calculations
or something is wrong with our data.
This insight would have been difficult to reach by
examining the data without visualization tools.

You can group similar plots in a single figure using subplots.
This script below uses a number of new commands. The function `matplotlib.pyplot.figure()`
creates a space into which we will place all of our plots. The parameter `figsize`
tells Python how big to make this space. Each subplot is placed into the figure using
its `add_subplot` **method**. The `add_subplot` method takes 3 parameters. The first denotes
how many total rows of subplots there are, the second parameter refers to the
total number of subplot columns, and the final parameter denotes which subplot
your variable is referencing (left-to-right, top-to-bottom). Each subplot is stored in a
different variable (`axes1`, `axes2`, `axes3`). Once a subplot is created, the axes can
be titled using the `set_xlabel()` command (or `set_ylabel()`).
Here are our three plots side by side:

<!--- 
import numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot
data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')
 --->
~~~python
fig = matplotlib.pyplot.figure(figsize=(10.0, 3.0))

axes1 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 1)
axes2 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 2)
axes3 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 3)

axes1.set_ylabel('average')
axes1.plot(numpy.mean(data, axis=0))

axes2.set_ylabel('max')
axes2.plot(numpy.max(data, axis=0))

axes3.set_ylabel('min')
axes3.plot(numpy.min(data, axis=0))

fig.tight_layout()
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
~~~

![The Previous Plots as Subplots](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/fig/01-numpy_80_0.png)

The **call** to `loadtxt` reads our data,
and the rest of the program tells the plotting library
how large we want the figure to be,
that we're creating three subplots,
what to draw for each one,
and that we want a tight layout.
(Perversely, if we leave out that call to `fig.tight_layout()`,
the graphs will actually be squeezed together more closely.)

**Key Points:**
- Use `# some kind of explanation` to add comments to programs.
- Use `numpy.mean(array)`, `numpy.max(array)`, and `numpy.min(array)` to calculate simple statistics.
- Use `numpy.mean(array, axis=0)` or `numpy.mean(array, axis=1)` to calculate statistics across the specified axis.
- Use the `pyplot` library from `matplotlib` for creating simple visualizations.
