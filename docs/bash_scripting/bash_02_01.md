Both these ARGUMENT values and well as STRINGS are examples of ARRAYS: indexed collections of elements sharing a common name.

+ example: fruit collections sharing a common name `"a"`
  * a=(apple pear plum)
  * a[1]="apple", a[2]="pear", a[3]="plum"

#### Array values
The way to enter and access array values if similar to that used for command line arguments. The `index` is indicated with `[]` after the variable name. Generally, array must also be surrounded by `{}` when report element values

```
prompt> val[1]=55 ; val[2]=72
prompt> mult=$(( ${val[1]} * ${val[2]})) ; echo $mult
3960
```
We can directly assign values to individual elements:
```
prompt> fruit[1]="apple"
```
or we use a `()` to assign them in batch:
```
prompt> fruit=(apple pear plum)
```
Arrays, like STRINGS, start counting at 0, so fruit[0] equals "apple".

Batch assignment is particularly useful for making lists:
```
prompt> touch actin.fa myosin.fa ssb.fa
prompt> filelist=($(/bin/ls *.fa))

### use ${#array[@]} Number of elements in array.

prompt> echo There are ${#filelist[@]} fasta files: ${filelist[@]}
There are 3 fasta files: actin.fa myosin.fa ssb.fa
prompt> echo ${filelist[2]}
ssb.fa
prompt> echo "length of element 1 :" ${#filelist[1]}
length of element 1 : 9

### use ${array[@]:position:range} to select limited elements
prompt> array_count=( one two three four five six )
prompt> echo ${array_count[@]:1:2}
two three
prompt> echo ${array_count[@]:(-3):2}
four five
```
As with strings, `read` can likewise be used to input elements of an array:
```
prompt> declare -a newA
prompt> echo -n 'Enter >3 values:' ; read -a newA
pickle fly pyramid<return>
prompt> echo "newA has ${#newA[@]} elements:" ${newA[@]}
newA has 3 elements: pickle fly pyramid
```
