# LOOPS
Loops in `bash` allows us to repeat a series of evaluations across a number of values. The values are typically in a sorted numerical range (1-10), but they can also be a list of values. Arrays are often used to store the ranges or lists.

## Types of loops
While there are several types of `bash` loops, among the most used are:
+ IF/THEN/ELSE
  * Conditional comparison
+ WHILE
  * repeat commands until a condition is met
+ FOR
  * repeat commands for a list  OR
  * repeat commands over a range.
