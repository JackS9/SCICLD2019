# Best Practices in Data Management and collaboration

### Course Objectives

This course is designed as an introduction to managing data on high performance computing clusters. It is intended to teach users to be self-sufficient and proactive in managing their own data in order to (1) increase their productivity, (2) maximize the usage of the existing storage, (3) decrease accidental or unintentional data loss, and (4) prevent disruption of the file system or compute nodes to the point where it may affect others. This course is intended for people who have beginner to intermediate familiarity with a command line interface, and have active accounts on a TACC HPC cluster.

This course is divided into four modules:

 1. [Overview of HPC Data Management](#mod1)
 2. [Navigating a File System](#mod2)
 3. [Moving and Backing up Data](#mod3)
 4. [Tips and Tricks for Maximizing File System Usage](#mod4)


### Instructional Objectives

This course should be taught in a room equipped with computers (or attendees with laptops) and internet access. Attendees should also have an existing allocation on a TACC resource. Attendees without an allocation can still participate in most components if they have a Mac / Linux laptop, or a Windows laptop with Putty installed and access to a Linux server.
