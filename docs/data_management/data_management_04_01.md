### Best Practices for file and directory organization

#### Organization is the key

#### Folder hierarchies
* Place folder and files in nested hierarchies
  + logically organized by concept
  + avoid folders with large numbers of file.
    * DISCUSSION: ***Why?***
  + when nesting, organize with names from the most broad concept at the top to the least broad for the final folders and files.
  + Follow a consistent tree structure for similar analyses

#### File names
* Naming conventions
  + only alphanumeric characters "\_" or "-"
  + Try to have informative extensions
    * `.exe`, `.txt`, `.script`
  + **EXAMPLE** :
    * `sample_method_initials_date_version.extension`
    * `mustard_chr1_assembly_bwb_060217.fasta`
* Consider having a `README.txt` file that describes the contents and naming conventions of your research folder.
