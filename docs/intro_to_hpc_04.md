## The .bashrc

Purpose: Automatically export environment variables or load modules on log in. (Many other things can be done to customize the shell)

Edit the file, which is located in the home directory:
```
$ vim ~/.bashrc
```

Source the file and it will take effect:
```
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

Alternatively, log out and back in for the file to take effect.


Note: TACC primarily uses .bashrc, other shells or clusters may use a different file. Ask your admin.
