## Instructors for Computational Techniques for Life Science 2017

All instructors for this Institute are part of the Life Science Computing group at TACC, and share the group mission to support life science computing on TACC hardware resources.

**Joe Allen** works with biomedical researchers in the Houston area to help solve challenging problems using high performance computing resources. Most of his experience is in computational structural biology and drug discovery, but lately he has been involved in several image processing, genomics, and pipeline / automation projects.

**Brian Beck** explores protein:protein interactions with a mixture of structural bioinformatics and traditional molecular modeling. He is the embedded liaison from TACC to researchers in the Dallas/Forth Worth area and also helps researchers new to cloud-computing use NSF's JETSTREAM cloud-computing resource. 

**James Carson** applies image informatics to a variety of biomedical research projects across neuroscience, pulmonology, and genomics. James leverages high performance computing to work with extremely large images and to develop computational workflows to efficiently leverage different resources. 

**Erik Ferlanti**

**John Fonner**

**Jawon Song** studies genetics and epigenetics for plant biology using bioinformatics workflows on TACC systems. Jawon works primarily on supporting biologists in both developing analytic methods for biological data and teaching students how to use HPC for routine genomics pipeline.

**Greg Zynda** is passionate about mathematics, computing, and data science. Applying these skills to the realm of biology has had him hooked for 7 years. At TACC, Greg studies DNA replication, epigenetics, and genome assembly. He also enjoys interacting with the community through CyVerse and the educators and students that visit TACC.
