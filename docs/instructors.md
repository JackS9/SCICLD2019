All instructors for this Institute are part of the Life Science Computing group at TACC, and share the group mission to support life science computing on TACC hardware resources.

**Joe Allen** 

**Brian Beck**

**James Carson** applies image informatics to a variety of biomedical research projects across neuroscience, pulmonology, and genomics. James leverages high performance computing to work with extremely large images and to develop computational workflows to efficiently leverage different resources. 

**Erik Ferlanti**

**John Fonner**

**Jawon Song** studies genetics and epigenetics for plant biology using bioinformatics workflows on TACC systems. Jawon works primarily on supporting biologists in both developing analytic methods for biological data and teaching students how to use HPC for routine genomics pipeline.

**Greg Zynda**
