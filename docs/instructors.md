## Instructors for Computational Techniques for Life Science 2018

All instructors for this Institute are part of the Life Science Computing group at TACC, and share the group mission to support life science computing on TACC hardware resources.

**Joe Allen** works with biomedical researchers in the Houston area to help solve challenging problems using high performance computing resources. Most of his experience is in computational structural biology and drug discovery, but lately he has been involved in several image processing, genomics, and pipeline / automation projects.

**Brian Beck** explores protein:protein interactions with a mixture of structural bioinformatics and traditional molecular modeling. He is the embedded liaison from TACC to researchers in the Dallas/Forth Worth area and also helps researchers new to cloud-computing use NSF's JETSTREAM cloud-computing resource. 

**James Carson** applies image informatics to a variety of biomedical research projects across neuroscience, pulmonology, and genomics. James leverages HPC to work with extremely large images and to develop computational workflows to efficiently utilize resources. 

**Charlie Dey** develops content and builds curriculums for TACC's academic course selections taught in conjunction with several departments at the University of Texas at Austin, as well as for TACC's professional development and educational training.

**Erik Ferlanti** is a full stack software engineer specializing in developing tools for bioinformatics research. At TACC, he works on portal development, building tools for cloud computing, and helping researchers design genomics workflows in an HPC environment.

**John Fonner** builds tools and infrastructure to make HPC broadly accessible for the biomedical researchers that need it. His background is in molecular modeling, but he has collaborated on projects for immunology, crop modeling, microbiome, drug discovery, and genomics.

**Harika Gurram** 

**Jawon Song** studies genetics and epigenetics for plant biology using bioinformatics workflows on TACC systems. Jawon works primarily on supporting biologists in both developing analytic methods for biological data and teaching students how to use HPC for routine genomics pipeline.

**Joshua Urrutia** 

**Greg Zynda** is passionate about mathematics, computing, and data science. Applying these skills to the realm of biology has had him hooked for 7 years. At TACC, Greg studies DNA replication, epigenetics, and genome assembly. He also enjoys interacting with the community through CyVerse and the educators and students that visit TACC.
