# Hands-On: Day 2

At the end of Day 2, we will have opportunity for some hands-on exercises. This is your opportunity to work one-on-one with one of us, or start applying the skills you learned to your own research questions. If you run into problems, we are here to help. Here are some ideas of things to work on:


1) Start compiling a list of the applications you need for your research. Search the module system for what is and is not available. Start installing the necessary applications in your `$WORK` space, and ask us for help if you get stuck

2) Start thinking about what data you need for your research. How will you manage and organize the data on TACC resources. Start transferring some data to TACC, and learn to use `rsync` to make syncing data between sites easier. We are here to help if you get stuck.
