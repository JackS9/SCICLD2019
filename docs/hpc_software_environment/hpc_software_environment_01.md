# HPC Software Environment: Introduction




### Module Objectives

Following along on the command line is **strongly encouraged**. We will go through these steps using a sample application called [Tophat](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/tutorial.shtml). If you would like to follow along with your own application instead, please do. Some parts of this module may not apply. After taking this module, participants should be able to:

 1. Navigate Lonestar5 effectively; identify compilers and dependencies
 2. Install an application (Tophat); ./configure, make, make install
 3. Test an application; idev; make test
 4. Profile an application; remora
 5. Share an application; chmod, chown, chgrp, ACLs (time permitting)
 6. Make your own modules
