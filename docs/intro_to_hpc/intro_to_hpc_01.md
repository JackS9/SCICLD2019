# Introduction to High Performance Computing

### Module Objectives

This module will be fully interactive. Participants are **strongly encouraged** to follow along on the command line. After taking this module, participants should be able to:

 * Print, identify, and modify environment variables
 * List and search for available modules
 * Load and unload modules specific to a certain objective
 * Automate module and environment commands in the `.bashrc`
 * Prepare and submit a batch job to a queue



### Basic High Performance Computing (HPC) System Architecture

### Tips for Success

*Read the [documentation](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides).*

 * Learn node schematics, limitations, file systems, rules
 * Learn about the scheduler, queues, policies
 * Determine the right resource for the job

HPC systems are shared resources. Your jobs and activity on a cluster, if mismanaged, can affect others. TACC staff are always [available to help](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/tacc-consulting).


### Topics Covered

 * Environment variables – purpose, printing, defining and piping (`echo, env, export, |`).
 * Modules – listing, loading, and unloading.
 * Automating environment variables, module commands, and aliases in `.bashrc`.
 * Batch job submission, commands dependent on system (`sbatch, showq, scancel`).
