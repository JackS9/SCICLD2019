## Batch Job Submission

As we discussed before, on Stampede2 there are login nodes and compute nodes.

<center><img src="../../resources/hpc_schematic.png" style="height:300px;"></center>

We cannot run the applications we need for our research on the login nodes because they require too many resources and will interrupt the work of others. Instead, we must write a short text file containing a list of the resources we need, and containing the command(s) for running the application. Then, we submit that text file to a queue to run on compute nodes. This process is called **batch job submission**.

There are several queues available on Stampede2. It is important to understand the queue limitations, and pick a queue that is appropriate for your job. Documentation can be found [here](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/stampede2#production-queues). Today, we will be using the `development` queue which has a max runtime of 2 hours, and users can only submit one job at a time.


First, navigate to the `Lab04` directory where we have an example job script prepared, called `job.slurm`:
```
$ cd
$ cd IntroToLinuxHPC/Lab04
$ cat job.slurm

#!/bin/bash
#----------------------------------------------------
# Example SLURM job script to run applications on
# TACCs Stampede2 system.
#----------------------------------------------------
#SBATCH -J               # Job name
#SBATCH -o               # Name of stdout output file (%j expands to jobId)
#SBATCH -p               # Queue name
#SBATCH -N               # Total number of nodes requested (16 cores/node)
#SBATCH -n               # Total number of mpi tasks requested
#SBATCH -t               # Run time (hh:mm:ss)
#SBATCH -A               # <-- Allocation name to charge job against

# Everything below here should be Linux commands

```

First, we must know an application we want to run, and a research question we want to ask. This generally comes from your own research. For this example, we want to use the application called `autodock_vina` to check how well a small molecule ligand fits within a protein binding site. All the data required for this job is in a subdirectory called `data`:
```
$ pwd
/home1/03439/wallen/IntroToLinuxHPC/Lab04
$ ls
data  job.slurm  results
$ ls data/
configuration_file.txt  ligand.pdbqt  protein.pdbqt
$ ls results/
     # nothing here yet
```

Next, we need to fill out `job.slurm` to request the necessary resources. I have some experience with `autodock_vina`, so I can reasonably predict how much we will need. When running your first jobs with your applications, it will take some trial and error, and reading online documentation, to get a feel for how many resources you should use. Open `job.slurm` with VIM and fill out the following information:
```
#SBATCH -J vina_job      # Job name
#SBATCH -o vina_job.o%j  # Name of stdout output file (%j expands to jobId)
#SBATCH -p development   # Queue name
#SBATCH -N 1             # Total number of nodes requested (16 cores/node)
#SBATCH -n 1             # Total number of mpi tasks requested
#SBATCH -t 00:10:00      # Run time (hh:mm:ss)
#SBATCH -A CTLS2018      # <-- Allocation name to charge job against
```

Now, we need to provide instructions to the compute node on how to run `autodock_vina`. This information would come from the `autodock_vina` instruction manual. Continue editing `job.slurm` with VIM, and add this to the bottom:
```
# Everything below here should be Linux commands

echo "starting at:"
date

module list
module load boost
module load autodock_vina
module list

cd data/
vina --config configuration_file.txt --out ../results/output_ligands.pdbqt

echo "ending at:"
date
```

The way this job is configured, it will print a starting date and time, load the appropriate modules, run `autodock_vina`, write output to the `results/` directory, then print the ending date and time. Keep an eye on the `results/` directory for output. Once you have filled in the job description, save and quit the file. Submit the job to the queue using the `sbatch` command`:
```
$ sbatch job.slurm
```

To view the jobs you have currently in the queue, use the `showq` or `squeue` commands:
```
$ showq -u
$ showq        # shows all jobs by all users
$ squeue -u $USERNAME
$ squeue       # shows all jobs by all users
```

If for any reason you need to cancel a job, use the `scancel` command with the 6- or 7-digit jobid:
```
$ scancel jobid
```

For more example scripts, see this directory on Stampede2:
```
$ ls /share/doc/slurm/
```

If everything went well, you should have an output file named something similar to `vina_job.o864828` in the same directory as the `job.slurm` script. And, in the `results/` directory, you should have some output:
```
$ more
$ cat vina_job.o864828
    # closely examine output

$ ls results
output_ligands.pdbqt
```

Congratulations! You ran a batch job on Stampede2!

### Other Considerations:

*Read the [documentation](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides).*

 * Learn node schematics, limitations, file systems, rules
 * Learn about the scheduler, queues, policies
 * Determine the right resource for the job
 * Practice, practice, practice.

HPC systems are shared resources. Your jobs and activity on a cluster, if mismanaged, can affect others. TACC staff are always [available to help](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/tacc-consulting).



### Review of Topics Covered

| Command             | Effect     |
|---------------------|------------|
| `sbatch job.slurm`  | submit batch job called "job.slurm" |
| `showq`             | show all running and queued jobs |
| `showq -u`          | show all running and queued jobs by this user |
| `scancel jobid`     | cancel a job with id "jobid" |
| `idev --help`       | show idev help text for running interactive jobs |
