# Introduction to Linux

### Module Objectives

This module will be fully interactive. Participants are **strongly encouraged** to follow along on the command line. Even if you already have Linux familiarity, please follow along becuase we will create files / directories that we use later on in the workshop. After completing this module, participants should be able to:

 * Describe basic functions of essential Linux commands
 * Use Linux commands to navigate a file system and manipulate files
 * Look up how to use unkown Linux commands
 * Edit files directly on a Linux system using a command line utility (e.g. vim, nano, emacs)


### Why Linux?

Linux is an operating system often cited for its:

 * Stability
 * Security
 * Speed
 * Compatibility
 * Control

These are all good reasons to use Linux. But the *real* reasons we are learning Linux today are:

 * **Most supercomputers you will use operate on Linux**
 * **Most life sciences software packages you will use were probably designed and optimized for Linux**


### Topics Covered

 * Looking and moving around (`pwd, ls, mkdir, cd, rmdir`)
 * Creating and manipulating files (`touch, rm, mv, cp`)
 * Looking at the contents of files (`cat, more, less, head, tail, grep`)
 * More files commands (`ln, chmod, tar, gzip`)
 * Network and file transfers (`hostname, whoami, logout, ssh, scp, rsync`)
 * Miscellaneous commands (`man, echo, which, date, history`)
 <!---* Shortcuts (`Tab, Up Arrow, Ctrl+c, Ctrl+d, ./, ../, ~/, >, >>, *, |, &`) --->
 * Text editing with vim (insert mode, normal mode, navigating, saving, quitting)
