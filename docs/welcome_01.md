## Objectives for the Computational Techniques for Life Sciences Summer Institute

 Provide attendees the basic skills needed to:

 1. Execute life sciences workflows on large-scale systems
 2. Run parallel analyses
 3. Use Bash/Python/Perl to chain common life sciences applications together to form more complex workflows
 4. Analyze and visualize result data in order to gain useful insights

## Basic High Performance Computing (HPC) System Architecture

Think of an HPC Resource as a very large and complicated lab instrument. Users need to learn how to:

 * Interface with it / push the right buttons (Linux)
 * Load samples (data)
 * Run experiments (jobs)
 * Interpret the results


![alt text](https://github.com/jamescarson3/ctls2017/blob/master/resources/hpc_schematic.tiff "Generic HPC Schematic")


Read the documentation.

 * Learn node schematics, limitations, file systems, rules
 * Learn about the scheduler, queues, policies
 * Determine the right resource for the job

HPC systems are shared resources. Your jobs and activity on a cluster, if mismanaged, can affect others.
