# Introduction to GNU Coreutils

The GNU Core Utilities are the basic file, shell and text manipulation utilities of the GNU operating system.
These are the core utilities which are expected to exist on every Unix-like operating system.

A mastery of these programs will allow you to write powerful pipelines and basic analyses without writing time-consuming code.
These skills will also transfer to _every_ Mac, Linux, HPC, and (now even) Windows machine that your workflows could run on.
