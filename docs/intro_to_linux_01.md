# Introduction to Linux

## Module Objectives

After taking this module, users should be able to:

 * Describe basic functions of essential Linux commands
 * Use Linux commands to navigate a file system and manipulate files
 * Look up how to use unkown Linux commands
 * Edit files directly on a Linux system using a command line utility (e.g. vim, nano, emacs)


## Why Linux?

 * Stability
 * Security
 * Speed
 * Compatibility
 * Control

 * **Most supercomputers you will use operate on Linux**
 * **Most life sciences software packages you will use were probably designed and optimized for Linux**


## Topics Covered:

 * Looking and moving around (`pwd, ls, mkdir, cd, rmdir`)
 * Creating and manipulating files (`touch, rm, mv, cp`)
 * Looking at the contents of files (`cat, more, less, head, tail`)
 * More files commands (`ln, chmod, grep, tar, gzip`)
 * Network and file transfers (`hostname, whoami, ssh, scp, rsync`)
 * Miscellaneous commands (`man, echo, which, diff, date, history, logout`)
 * Shortcuts (`Tab, Up Arrow, Ctrl+c, Ctrl+d, ./, ../, ~/, >, >>, *, |, &`)
 * Text editing with vim (insert mode, normal mode, navigating, saving, quitting)
