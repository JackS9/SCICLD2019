### Objectives for the Computational Techniques for Life Sciences Summer Institute

 Provide attendees the basic skills needed to:

 1. Nagivate access to data and software on large-scale compute systems
 2. Use Bash to chain common life sciences applications together to form more complex workflows
 3. Design tasks to run in parallel to appropriately utilizie large-scale resources
 2. Use reproducible software approaches and to share your analysis in a way that others can reproduce
 
 In addition, attendees will receive feedback and support on their specific research challenges and goals.
